### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

My name is **Alexandre Jardin**. I work at Emakina in France and I am one of the founding members of the
local [AFUP][1] branch.

I have been working for years within the PHP ecosystem, building **Magento** and **Symfony** applications. My favourite
part of the job? Helping development teams by working on **industrialization** and **performance improvements**.

I am also a **code quality advocate** and the proud owner of **four certifications**. Even if some of them deserve to
be renewed... Maybe Symfony will be added to the list in the near future. ðŸ¤ž

In addition to my full-time job, I give courses on **Docker** at [the university][2] and courses on **code management**
(Git, dependency manager, quality audits, continuous integration, and unit/functional tests) at [the 3iL Academy][3].
And in my spare time, I'm working on a [side project][4] to make it easier **to orchestrate local Docker environments**.

See you soon!
